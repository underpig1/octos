# Quickstart

## Installation

> Download the Octos app for Windows (under construction)

Visit [Octos Releases](https://github.com/underpig1/octos/releases) to download the latest binaries. Note: your OS may give a Smartscreen warning. I haven't yet gotten around to certifying/signing the app. Right now, I just want to get your impressions and testing on the app, but in the next phase (soon) I'll be working on that as well as hopefully publishing to the Microsoft Store.

If you have npm, you can use it instead to just test out the app without installing.
Clone the repository and run `npm install` and `npm start`.

## Usage

Once you install Octos, run the executable to start the app. When active, Octos lives in your system tray.

To see the quick access menu, right click on the tray icon. Here you can quickly switch between wallpapers, add a new one, and configure some settings. To pull up the Octos GUI, left click the Octos icon in the tray or open the quick access menu and click "Open."

The Octos app lets you explore community modules, view and manage your installed mods, create new mods for yourself or to share, and configure some app/system settings.
