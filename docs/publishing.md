# Publish your mod

Follow this guide to learn how to share your mod on the Octos platform for others to download from the Octos app.

### Publish on the platform

The Octos Community repository stores a collection of community mods that are downloadable from the Explore page in the Octos app:
https://github.com/underpig1/octos-community

If you're interested in contributing to the collection, it's as easy as...
1. Fork [the repo](https://github.com/underpig1/octos-community)
2. Add your own custom mod folder (not the packaged .omod file) under the `src/` folder in the repo
3. Run `npm run build` in the root directory of the repo (this packages all the mods in the `src/` directory into the .omod file format)
4. [Submit a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to merge your fork with the master

Contributions are always appreciated!
