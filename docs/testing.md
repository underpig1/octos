# Test your mod

You can test your mod without packaging/bundling/installing it from the Developer Menu or from the command line:

### From the Developer Menu
The Develop page in the Octos app has mod controls which let you run/terminate your mod without packaging it. It also includes a debug tool to toggle developer tools. Press the play button to start running your mod.

### From the CLI
Alternatively, using the command line, run `octos run [path]` to run the mod folder/.omod file at the given path. use the optional `--devtools` flag to enable developer tools.
