# Package your mod

If you want to distribute your mod for others to use and install from the Octos app, you'll need to bundle it into a `.omod` file first. Follow this guide to learn how with the Octos Developer Menu or with the CLI.

### From the Developer Menu
Click "Build and share" to export your mod in the `.omod` file format.

### From the CLI
In the command line, run `octos build path/to/mod/folder` to bundle your mod folder into a distributable `.omod` file.

### Publish
If you want Octos users to be able to see and install your mod from the Explore page, see the [pulishing guide](https://underpig1.github.io/octos/docs/?t=publishing) for more details.
