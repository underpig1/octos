# Packaging your mod

If you want to distribute your mod for others to use and install from the Octos app, you'll need to bundle it into a `.omod` file first. Follow this guide to learn how to do this with the Octos GUI or with the CLI.

### From the Developer Menu

### From the CLI
In the command line, run `octos build path/to/mod/folder` to bundle your mod folder into a distributable `.omod` file.

### Publish
If you want Octos users to be able to see and install your mod from the Explore page, see the [pulishing guide](https://underpig1.github.io/octos/docs/?t=publish) for more details.
